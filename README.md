Hi there,

I have created a web automation project for the WiseLive Web Application to enhance my hands-on experience in automation. WiseLive is a platform designed for teaching businesses, helping manage scheduling, invoicing, learners, tutors, and moreâ€”at scale.

In this project, I automated the login process, session scheduling with dynamic time selection, and logout to create a complete end-to-end flow.

Technologies Used:
Maven as the build tool
Selenium for web automation
Java for scripting
TestNG as the testing framework
Page Object Model (POM) for structured test design
A separate utility file for reusable methods
